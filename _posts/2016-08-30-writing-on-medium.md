title: Writing on Medium
---

I found that Medium is a great platform for sharing all kinds of content, and on top of that it uses algorithms to recommend posts to other uses. I plan to keep writing technical posts using my github.io, but write more mainstream articles on medium. 

#### Here are some of my posts on Medium
