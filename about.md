## About me

I am an avid learner and ask a lot of questions. I believe asking questions is an effective way to learn and share ideas. I'm very interested in natural language processing, machine intelligence, and psychology. I also write on [medium](https://medium.com/@rtotheohan).

I currently study Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at Columbia University. My advisor is [Kathy McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/).
