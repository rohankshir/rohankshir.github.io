### 


I currently work at Koko, a VC backed company focused on at bringing emotional well being to the world. I currently study Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at Columbia University. My advisor is [Kathy McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/). I also work with [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) at NYU. 

I am an avid learner and ask a lot of questions. I believe asking questions, thinking hard about a problem, and writing your thoughts is an effective process to learn and share ideas. I'm very interested in natural language processing, machine intelligence, and psychology. I also write on [medium](https://medium.com/@rtotheohan).
