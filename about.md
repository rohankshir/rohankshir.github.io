## About me

I am an avid learner and ask a lot of questions. I believe asking questions is an effective way to learn and share ideas. My predominant technical interests include writing efficient, reliable, and well-designed code, dabbling in machine learning, and recently, trying to visualize data. Aside from that, I like to play and follow soccer, weight lift, jam on a guitar, and play chess.
